package Interface;

public interface a1 { 
    void fun();

    // these are interface and it is same as abstract their function also have no body
    //but the main differnce is that it allow multiple inheritance
    // meaning a single child can inherit two interface properteis
    // like a single child can inherit two parent properties
}
